Description: Method to identify outlying points recorded by a Conductivity, 
  Temperature, and Depth (CTD) meter along a depth profile, which are not 
  congruent with the range of measurements taken in the surrounding water 
  column. These are labeled as incongruent points. For this, the package 
  includes a function to import and format .vp2 files, as well as functions to 
  visualize depth profiles and the incongruent points they contain.
