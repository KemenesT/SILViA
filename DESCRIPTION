Description: Method to identify outlying points recorded by a Valeport
    (<https://www.valeport.co.uk/>) Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth
    (CTD) meter along a depth profile, which are not congruent with the
    range of measurements taken in the surrounding water column. These are
    labeled as incongruent points. For this, the package includes a
    function to import and format .vp2 files, as well as functions to
    visualize depth profiles and the incongruent points they contain.
